📈 ISLP Linear Regression — Labs & Exercises

This repository contains my hands-on work from the ISLP (Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python) Linear Regression labs and exercises. The goal of this project is to build a strong practical foundation in regression modeling, interpretation, and diagnostics using real datasets.

📂 Repository Contents

LinearRegression.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook with solved labs and exercises covering:

Simple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Categorical variables in regression

Model evaluation & diagnostics

Interpretation of coefficients

Assumption checking

Datasets Used

Auto.csv

Boston.csv

Carseats.csv

These datasets are widely used in statistical learning to understand real-world regression scenarios.

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

✔ Understanding linear regression theory in practice
✔ Implementing regression models using statsmodels
✔ Handling categorical predictors
✔ Evaluating model performance
✔ Checking regression assumptions
✔ Interpreting statistical outputs confidently

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
